        <h1>J. Robert Oppenheimer</h1>
        <h3>Theoretical Physicist</h3>
        <p>“We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty, and to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.”</p>

            <p>Beginning in 1947, Oppenheimer directed the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he convened great scientists. “What we don’t understand, we explain to each other.” </p>

            <p>The joint effort of outstanding scientists at Los Alamos culminated in the first nuclear explosion on July 16, 1945, at the Trinity Site near Alamogordo, New Mexico, after the surrender of Germany.</p>

            <div class="line"></div>
            <P>Enrolled at Harvard in September 1922. I graduated in three years, excelling in a wide variety of subjects. Although majoring in chemistry, I eventually realized my true passion was the study of physics.
            In 1925, I began my graduate work in physics at Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England. J. J. Thomson, who had been awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for detecting the electron, agreed to take me on as a student. <br> At Cavendish, I realized that my talent was for theoretical, not experimental, physics, and he accepted an invitation from Max Born, director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Göttingen, to study with me in Germany.</P></div>
